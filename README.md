# Welcome to the sacred pantheon of errors.

Ever had an error that made you hit your head against a wall for days? well, we are legion. And I'm sure we don't want anybody else to go through that experience.

The goal of this project is to beecome a reference, a place where especially beginners can come and quickly identify the error they are getting and solve it.

But we want to do it the right way. To contribute, open an issue with the title being the error message or something very close to it if it's too long. Then label your issue with the corresponding topics. The issue description must have 3 parts:
- WHY am I getting this error/ WHAT is causing it
- HOW to solve this
- WHY your solution works.

Make sure to give detailed explanations in each of the sections. Sometimes there is more than one way to solve an error. If it happends that someone has already opened an issue about the error you want to add, make sure that the solution you propose is different from the one that already exists, if it is the case, feel free to open your issue with the same name as the previous followed by #2, #3...according to the number of issues opened about that error. If your solution has already been listed, please don't open another issue, discuss about what you want to add or retrieve from the opened issue in the comments.

That's it. I hope this will live up to be a great project :)
